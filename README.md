# S3-Redshift-IAM


This project integrates three key Amazon Web Services—S3, IAM, and Redshift—to create a scalable and secure data storage and analysis solution. The project demonstrates how to efficiently manage data access, storage, and processing within a cloud environment.

Components include
Amazon S3: Used for storing raw data files in a highly durable and scalable environment. S3 provides the foundation for our data lake.

IAM (Identity and Access Management): Implements fine-grained access control policies to ensure secure interactions with AWS resources, safeguarding data and infrastructure.

Amazon Redshift: Deployed for data warehousing and running complex queries on large datasets, enabling high-performance data analysis.


Data Ingestion: Data is uploaded to S3.
Access Management: IAM policies are applied to control access to S3 buckets and Redshift clusters.
Data Processing: Data from S3 is loaded into Redshift for analysis.
